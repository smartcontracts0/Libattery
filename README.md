# Blockchain-enabled Sustainability of Li-ion Batteries Supply Chain: Tracking and Sourcing Eco-Friendly Materials [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/973269955.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15288115)


This repository provides the complete smart contracts, testing files, and security analysis reports for the research paper:  
**"Blockchain-enabled Sustainability of Li-ion Batteries Supply Chain: Tracking and Sourcing Eco-Friendly Materials."**

## Project Overview

This project introduces a comprehensive blockchain-based system designed to enhance traceability, ethical sourcing, sustainability, and waste management in the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery supply chain. Key innovations include:

- **Smart Contracts (SCs):** Modular contracts covering mining, refinement, manufacturing, distribution, retailing, trading, and waste management phases.
- **NFTs (ERC-721 Standard):** Tokenization of raw materials, batteries, and lots to ensure ownership verification and traceability.
- **Decentralized Storage (IPFS):** Secure and cost-efficient off-chain data storage.
- **Decision Framework:** Structured stakeholder guidance to improve ethical sourcing, compliance, and sustainability.
- **Testing and Validation:** Functional testing using REMIX IDE, gas consumption analysis, and security auditing.

## Repository Structure

- `/SmartContractCode`: Solidity smart contracts for managing all phases of the Li-ion battery supply chain.
- `/SecurityAnalysisReport`: Vulnerability reports generated by Slither for each smart contract (Mining, Manufacturing, Distribution, Retailing, and Trading).
- `/TestingScenario`: A documented testing guide (`TestingScenario.pdf`) outlining smart contract deployment order, transaction examples, and process flows.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**  
   Use [REMIX IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or a local Ethereum development environment (e.g., Ganache, Hardhat).

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**  
   Deploy the smart contracts in the following order to ensure dependency resolution:
   - Registration SC
   - Mining SC
   - Manufacturing SC
   - Distribution SC
   - Retailing SC
   - Waste Management SC
   - Trading SC
   - NFTs (Refined Minerals, Batteries, Battery Lots)

3. **Testing Procedures:**  
   Follow the steps outlined in `/TestingScenario/TestingScenario.pdf`, which document:
   - Mining permission requests
   - Material refinement and manufacturing
   - NFT minting and ownership transfers
   - Trading and retailing operations
   - Battery recycling and waste management
   - Gas cost evaluations

4. **Security Analysis:**  
   Review `/SecurityAnalysisReport/` to examine vulnerabilities detected by Slither, covering reentrancy, timestamp issues, and unsafe transfer patterns for each contract.

5. **Dependencies:**  
   - Solidity version ≥ 0.8.0
   - OpenZeppelin libraries (e.g., ReentrancyGuard for security)
